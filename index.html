  <p><strong>Brief Bio</strong></p>
  I was fortunate enough to be born to a family of nurturing, ethical and free thinking parents. My mom was a singer, and certified music teacher who decided it was much more worth her while to be a stay at home mom.
  My dad was a speech teacher, and self-taught caricature artist who made up his own "Phonics Alphabet" to use with his students at school.
  My brother found his niche in drumming and drawing early, and became a skilled drummer and artist. I found my musical voice in playing trumpet at an early age,
  and also found joy in drawing and painting. Another twist of fortune was to grow up in a small town that emphasized the importance of art and music.
  The Taylorville, IL Schools just happened to have top-notch teachers for both art and music at that time.

  Further on, I followed my interests in both art and music during my university studies at both Lincoln Land Community College and Eastern Illinois University.
  These programs offered me a good foundational learning of ensemble playing for music; and application of studio skills for drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture and design.
