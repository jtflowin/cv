  <p><strong>Brief Bio</strong></p>
I grew up in the midwest, near Springfield, Illinois. As a child, I was blessed to have smart and clever parents who loved me unconditionally... (even if I chose Art and Music as my primary vocation)!
  My early interests in art stemmed from watching my dad do some cartooning with pen and ink. I also occasionally found myself in a drawing competition with my older brother... 
  we would draw rather 'unflattering' pictures of each other, and have our family vote on who's picture was the 'cruelist'. . . (my brother usually won)!
  My mom sang operah, and was a voice major in college. She introduced me to notation and reading music. 

  Approximately 15 years later, I found myself going to college, and having trouble deciding between art or music as a major. Since computers seem to be the wave of future success— I chose graphic design as a major. 
  After numerous courses in art studio classes and graphic arts technical courses, I finally graduated with a BA, Graphic Design option. I have worked at several companies since achieving this degree.
